Udacity Cloud DevOps ND / High Availability App / Cloudformation
This repository was created as submission to Udacities 'Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation' Project (Cloud DevOps Nanodegree).

# Introduction
The goal of this project is to deploy an application in an automated fashion using AWS cloudformation.
The resulting infrastructure can be discarded and rebuild at any time.

In this scenario an app called Udagram is supposed to be deployed in a high-available and automated fashion.
The application data is located in a S3 Bucket.

To-Do's:
* create an Infrastructure Diagram
* create the S3 Bucket and place the application code in it (since there is no bucket yet)
* create the neccessary Cloudformation Scripts
